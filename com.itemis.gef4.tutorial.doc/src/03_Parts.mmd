# Step 4 -Creating the controller (Parts)

Parts are the connection between the model and the visuals (view).

1. Create a new plugin project or import the example project: com.itemis.gef4.tutorial.mindmap
2. Add the dependencies: 
3. Create parts for our model classes.
4. Create factory, which create the parts based on the model class
5. Create the anchor provider we are already using in the ConnectionPart
6. Create the module and inject at least one heometryprovder (like SelectionOutlineProvider) because they are used in the anchor!!
